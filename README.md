# Python-Image-to-ASCII
 A Python script that converts an image to an ASCII representation

Things I wish to add:
	- Prompt user to enter a filename
	- Ability to convert multiple files
	- Scale down larger images that are difficult to fit on the screen
	- Read available characters from a "charset.txt" list
